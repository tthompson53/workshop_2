Everything's wrong,  
Days are too long,  
Sunshine's too hot,  
Wind is too strong.  
Clouds are too fluffy,  
Grass is too green,  
Ground is too dusty,  
Sheets are too clean.  
Stars are too twinkly,  
Moon is too high,  
Water's too drippy,  
Sand is too dry.   
Rocks are too heavy,  
Feathers too light,  
Kids are too noisy,  
Shoes are too tight.  
Folks are too happy,  
Singin' their songs.  
Why can't they see it?  
Everything's wrong!
